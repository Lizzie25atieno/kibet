# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python script performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style and a touch of humor. 😎

## Features ✨
- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division

## How to Use 🚀
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter the second number when prompted.
4. Watch as the calculator magically computes and displays:
   - The **sum** of the two numbers
   - The **difference** between them
   - The **product** of the numbers
   - The **quotient** (division result)

## Example Usage 💻
```bash
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Important Notes ⚠️
- The calculator uses `float()` to handle decimal numbers.
- Division by zero will cause an error (we trust you to avoid math disasters! 😅).

## Requirements 🛠️
- Python 3.x

## License 📄
This project is open-source and free to use. Enjoy calculating like a boss! 🎩✨
